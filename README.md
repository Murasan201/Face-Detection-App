# Face Detection App

## Overview
This project is a simple Python application that uses OpenCV to perform face detection on an image file provided by the user. It allows users to select an image, detect faces, and draw rectangles around detected faces.

## Features
- Face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier.
- Select any image file (JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF) for face detection.
- Display the image with rectangles drawn around detected faces.
- Easy-to-use graphical interface with Tkinter.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- Tkinter (usually included with Python by default)

## Installation
First, clone this repository and install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pillow
```

## Usage
1. Run the `face_detection_app.py` script.
   ```bash
   python face_detection_app.py
   ```
2. A GUI window will appear. Click "Select Image" to choose an image file.
3. The app will detect faces in the image and display the result with rectangles around the detected faces.
